## Idea

Make a website that shows a video of a person saying the day, date and time.

The site will have more than 8784 videos (only talking about day, month and time), but using artificial intelligence this number can be reduced to just 1 video and 67 audios

You need to make an audio for every hour, day and month. Using these audios it is possible to combine them and use artificial intelligence to synchronize with the video
